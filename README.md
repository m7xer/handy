## install

- ensure internect connectivity
- ensure you have "a recent" nodejs/npm installed
- `git clone git@github.com:m7xer/handy.git`
- `cd handy`
- `npm install`

### generateChirpCSV

Generate CSV for CHIRP programming, with the 60 most local UK repeaters with access tones, and a bunch of satellites with Doppler adjusted downlinks.

Usage:
Pass in your UK [Maidenhead locator](https://www.levinecentral.com/ham/grid_square.php) to obtain the nearest 2M and 70CM analogue voice repeaters for you. Satellite data will be augmented before the final CSV is generated. Modify the script for more features as YMMV!

`
./scripts/generateChirpCSV IO92BL
`

Example Output:
```
$ ./scripts/generateChirpCSV IO92BL
#####
UK Maidenhead locator required for best results! for example:
./scripts/generateChirpCSV IO92BL
home location calculated from IO92BL as {"lat":52.458333333333336,"lon":-1.9166666666666667}

Suggested workflow for your radio:
- open CHIRP
- download from radio
- backup *.img file
- import the CSV
- load into default rows (or modify if you know what you're doing)
- save the *.img file
- upload to radio
- profit

## html

### repeaterMap.html

Displays repeaters on a zoomable open street map in a way that is somewhat more printable than others available. This is a handy reference when trying to identify repeater positions to contact from your newly programmed radio.

<!-- ![alt text](/img/repeaterMapSample.png?raw=true) -->
![alt text](https://github.com/m7xer/handy/blob/main/img/repeaterMapSample.png?raw=true)
- 2M repeaters = blue, above the marker line
- 70CM repeaters = dark red, below the marker line

Station names are given in truncated form and with their zero-based index as they appear in the json (such as that generated by generateChirpCSV which is sorted by ascending distance from the maidenhead lat-lon).

ie. The 70CM repeater GB3EH which was the 20th nearest (and so will be on channel 19 in your radio) becomes:
```
                      ----x----
                       3EH(19)
```

Usage:

`
open html/repeaterMap.html  
`

Advanced usage:
- paste the output from generateChirpCSV suitableRepeaters or allRepeaters json into the repeaters var at the bottom of repeaterMap.html
- modify `center: [52.458333333333336, -1.9166666666666667]` at the top to see a custom view, save and refresh.
- modify to display any other repeaters or areas of interest.

# TODO

- ~~csv generator for repeaters~~
- ~~offer ukrepeater info as json (can be found in allRepeaters json output from running generateChirpCSV)~~
- ~~printable local repeater map~~
- spit out a repeaterMap from generateChirpCSV into /scratchpad
- allow for custom output folder for all the csv/json
- calendar with local net info
- generate elevation LOS graphs for repeaters using https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/overview?hl=ru
- refactor so it's more maintainable, use ramda for neater list processing, make js adhere to [standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard).
- grc files for various flows (maybe in a different sdr project)
